# Sci-Fi Poem Generator
Paying homage to my undergrad major...

I love poetry and sci-fi. I decided to do a fun twist on a random word generator. The generator is trained on simple markov chains. I realize there's only a few good sentences in here I'm going to be constantly tuning and improving until it spits out the most beautiful space poetry in the the doggam universe.
